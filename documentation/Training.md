# Training

### What is Training?

Neural networks don't run on magic. They run on cold hard mathematics and algorithms built by hardworking computer scientists with no degrees. Training is one of these cold hard algorithms and it lets the neural network know how each product looks like. With Nomad, training a neural network to recognize products is easy!

### Process

1. [Log in](/signin) or [make a new account](/signup) with Nomad.
2. Click on the New Project tab <br>![New Project Tab](/docs/new_project.png)
3. Click the New Model button. Fill out the required information about a specific product model you want to recognize. Then upload a zip (not zipped directory) containing all the images you have of that model.
4. Create as many product models as you would like!
5. To delete a model, click the trash can icon
6. Train your project by pressing the Train button. This process may take some time (8+ hours depending on how many images) so take a coffee break!
7. Test your model by clicking on the Test button and uploading an image. The result will appear below the button
8. That's it!
